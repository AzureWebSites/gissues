# Welcome to gissues - whiteboard for GitHub issues
===

**Quick start**

- Go to http://gissues.com
- Log in to GitHub using your GitHub credentials and authorize gissues.com to manipulate issues in your public github repositories (using OAuth).
- Choose a repository from the drop-down, then drag & drop your issues across columns in the scrumboard or reorder them within a given column.
- Filter by issue labels, login of the assignee, or login of people mentioned in the issue history.
- The URL in the address bar of the browser is your permalink to the very query you constructed. Sharing that URL allows others to view the very same issues as long as they have adequate GitHub permissions (the URL does not capture your authorization information)

**What you should know about**

- The service is free. 
- The service modifies the description of your GitHub issues by adding a small textual fragment that captures gissues metadata. 
- The service does not otherwise affect any your GitHub projects, issues, comments, wikis, etc. 
- The service is available for public repositories only.
- It is provided as-is, use at your own risk.
